# JWT Authentication & Refresh Token Architecture

We standardize on asymmetric RSA-256 (RS256) JWTs for API authentication across all microservices.

## Architecture Specifications
1. **Signing Algorithm**: RS256 with 4096-bit private keys. Public keys are exposed via standard JWKS at `/.well-known/jwks.json`.
2. **Access Token Lifetime**: Exactly **15 minutes**. Never grant access tokens longer than 1 hour.
3. **Refresh Tokens**: Stored in PostgreSQL with SHA-256 hash. Valid for 14 days with sliding expiration on each use.
4. **Transport**: Access tokens in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. Refresh tokens exclusively in `httpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict` cookies.
5. **Mandatory Claims**:
   - `sub`: User UUIDv7
   - `iss`: `https://auth.company.dev`
   - `aud`: `https://api.company.dev`
   - `exp`: UNIX timestamp (15m from issuance)
   - `roles`: Array of assigned RBAC role strings.
