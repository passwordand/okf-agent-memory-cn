# OpenTelemetry Distributed Tracing Standard

Distributed tracing allows end-to-end request visibility across our microservices architecture.

## Requirements
1. **Context Propagation Protocol**: Mandates **W3C Trace Context** (`traceparent` and `tracestate` HTTP headers).
2. **Span Naming**: Must follow OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions:
   - HTTP Server: `{http.method} {http.route}` (e.g. `POST /api/v1/checkout`)
   - Database: `{db.operation} {db.name}.{db.table}` (e.g. `SELECT benchmark_db.users`)
3. **Sampling Strategy**: 100% trace sampling in staging; adaptive 5% head-based sampling in production with 100% error capture.
