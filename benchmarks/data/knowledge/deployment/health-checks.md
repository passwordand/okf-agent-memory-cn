# Kubernetes Liveness and Readiness Probe Architecture

To ensure zero-downtime rolling deployments, all HTTP services must expose distinct health probe endpoints:

## Endpoints
1. **Liveness Probe**: `GET /healthz`
   - Checks only internal process health (goroutines, memory leaks, event loop responsiveness).
   - **MUST NOT** check external dependencies (database, Redis, external APIs).
   - Fails only if the process is deadlocked and needs a container restart.
2. **Readiness Probe**: `GET /readyz`
   - Verifies that the pod can accept live client traffic.
   - Checks connection pool ping to PostgreSQL and Redis.
   - Returns HTTP 503 if database connection is down, causing Kubernetes Service routing to temporarily bypass the pod.
