* **Security**: Hardened bundle operations and mutations against path traversal and symlink escapes (LFI and arbitrary file write prevention) via canonical boundary verification in `LoadBundle`, `SaveConcept`, `UpdateParentIndex`, and `AppendLogEntry`.
* **Security**: Enforced single-line constraints and frontmatter delimiter sanitization on concept metadata to prevent YAML attribute smuggling.
