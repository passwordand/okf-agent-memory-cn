# Contributor Guidelines & PR Standards

This convention establishes the quality gates, engineering expectations, and verification standards for contributors—both human developers and AI agents—contributing to `okf-agent-memory`.

---

## 1. Non-Negotiable Core Tenets

All contributions must adhere to three foundational constraints:

1. **Zero External Dependencies**:
   - The Go library (`pkg/okf`) and CLI (`cmd/okf`) must rely exclusively on the Go standard library.
   - External dependencies (e.g. third-party YAML parsers or search engines) are strictly forbidden to ensure instant compilation, zero supply-chain risk, and painless cross-platform compilation.
2. **OKF v0.2 Specification Conformance**:
   - The project's own `knowledge/` bundle and all bundles scaffolded by `okf bootstrap` or `okf init` must strictly conform to the Open Knowledge Format v0.2 specification.
3. **Walk the Talk (Persistent Knowledge Maintenance)**:
   - Any pull request that alters architecture, introduces CLI flags, adjusts conventions, or resolves non-trivial design decisions must update `knowledge/` and maintain `knowledge/log.md`.

---

## 2. Development & Build Standards

- **Go Version**: Go 1.24+ (or Go 1.26).
- **Formatting**: Go code must be formatted with standard formatting tools (`gofumpt` or `go fmt`).
- **Static Analysis**: Code must pass `go vet ./...` without diagnostics.
- **Testing**: Unit tests in `pkg/okf` must maintain complete coverage and pass with `make test`.

---

## 3. Knowledge Maintenance Rules for PRs

When preparing a Pull Request:
1. **Search Before Authoring**: Run `okf search "<query>"` before adding new concepts to prevent duplicate files.
2. **Deterministic CLI Operations**: Use `okf create`, `okf update`, and `okf relate` to mutate knowledge files and update graph links.
3. **Graph Integrity**: Every new concept must be linked into the inbound/outbound graph. No orphaned concepts are permitted under `--strict` mode.
4. **Validation**: The bundle must pass strict validation before opening a PR:
   ```bash
   make validate
   # or: okf validate knowledge --strict --drift
   ```

---

## 4. Pre-Submission Quality Gate

Before requesting a review or merging into `main`, verify:
- [ ] `go fmt ./...` produces no diffs.
- [ ] `go vet ./...` reports zero issues.
- [ ] `make test` runs with 100% passing unit tests.
- [ ] `make validate` exits with code 0 (`0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 orphans, 0 broken links`).
- [ ] Conventional Commit format used for all commit messages.
