# Contributing to OKF Agent Memory

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **OKF Agent Memory**! We welcome contributions from developers, researchers, and AI practitioners.

## 🧭 Core Principles

Before submitting code or documentation, please keep our core tenets in mind:

1. **Zero External Dependencies**: The Go core library and CLI (`pkg/okf`, `cmd/okf`) must remain 100% zero-dependency, relying strictly on the Go standard library.
2. **Strict Spec Conformance**: All knowledge structures must comply with the [OKF v0.2 Specification](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md).
3. **Walk the Talk (Memory First)**: Any pull request introducing architectural decisions, CLI commands, or workflow conventions must update `knowledge/` and pass validation.

## 🛑 Issue-First Contribution Policy

To maintain architectural focus, prevent duplicated effort, and protect maintainer bandwidth:

1. **Always Open an Issue First**:
   - Before writing code or opening a Pull Request, please **open a GitHub Issue** to discuss the bug, proposed feature, or architectural change.
   - Wait for alignment and confirmation from maintainers before starting implementation.
2. **Unsolicited & Agent-Generated PRs**:
   - Pull Requests submitted without an associated approved issue, or automated sweeps by AI agents with generic or empty templates, will be **closed without review**.
3. **Exceptions**:
   - Minor typos or grammar fixes in documentation do not require an issue, but still require a filled-out PR description.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Go**: 1.24 or higher
- **Make**: Recommended for build and test targets
- **Git**

### Getting Started

1. **Fork and clone** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/okf-agent-memory.git
   cd okf-agent-memory
   ```

2. **Build the binary**:
   ```bash
   make build
   # Binary will be placed in bin/okf
   ```

3. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

4. **Validate the repository's knowledge bundle**:
   ```bash
   make validate
   # or: ./bin/okf validate knowledge --strict --drift
   ```

## 📋 Development Workflow

### 1. Branching Strategy
- Base all feature and bugfix branches off **`develop`** (our default branch):
  ```bash
  git checkout develop
  git pull origin develop
  git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
  # or
  git checkout -b fix/issue-description
  ```
- The **`main`** branch is reserved strictly for published, tagged production releases. Do not open feature PRs against `main`.

### 2. Commit Message Conventions
We adhere to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
- `feat:` A new feature or capability (e.g. `feat: add bm25 scoring boost for tags`)
- `fix:` A bug fix (e.g. `fix: handle missing frontmatter delimiter safely`)
- `docs:` Documentation updates
- `refactor:` Code refactoring with no behavioral changes
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Build scripts, CI workflow, or release updates

### 3. Knowledge & Memory Maintenance
If your PR modifies architecture, CLI behavior, conventions, or APIs:
- Use `./bin/okf` (or `okf`) to create or update concepts:
  ```bash
  ./bin/okf create <concept-id> knowledge --type <type> --title "<title>" --desc "<summary>"
  ./bin/okf update <concept-id> knowledge --desc "<new-summary>"
  ./bin/okf relate <src-id> <target-id> knowledge --desc "<relationship>"
  ```
- Verify that `knowledge/log.md` and parent indices are cleanly maintained.
- Ensure strict conformance and zero drift:
  ```bash
  make validate
  ```

### 4. Dogfooding & Embedded Asset Synchronization
This repository dogfoods its own conventions and agent skills:
- **Single Source of Truth**: The active skill files located in `.agents/skills/okf-memory/` are the authoritative source for agent skills.
- **Embedded Bootstrap Assets**: The assets compiled into the binary under `pkg/okf/assets/skill/` are used by `okf bootstrap` to initialize external projects. They must remain 100% byte-identical to `.agents/skills/okf-memory/`.
- **Sync Command**: Whenever you modify skills in `.agents/skills/okf-memory/`, run:
  ```bash
  make sync-assets
  ```
- **Template Neutrality**: Scaffold templates in `pkg/okf/assets/templates/` (such as `AGENTS.md`) are distributed to third-party codebases. They must remain completely project-neutral and must never contain repository-internal paths, constraints, or tokens.
- **Automated Verification**: `TestDogfoodingAssetDrift` in `pkg/okf/dogfood_test.go` runs during `make test` and `make check`, failing the build if assets drift or if internal tokens leak into templates.

## 🧪 Pre-Submission Checklist

Before submitting a Pull Request, verify that all of the following pass locally:

- [ ] `go fmt ./...` (or `make fmt`) has been run.
- [ ] `go vet ./...` (or `make vet`) passes without errors.
- [ ] `make test` runs with 100% passing tests (including dogfood asset drift checks).
- [ ] If skills were modified, `make sync-assets` has been run.
- [ ] `make validate` passes with `0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 orphans, 0 broken links`.
- [ ] Relevant documentation (`README.md`, `docs/`, `SKILL.md`) is updated.

## 🚀 Submitting a Pull Request

1. Verify that your PR addresses an **approved GitHub Issue** (or is an obvious documentation typo fix).
2. Push your branch to your fork.
3. Open a Pull Request against **`develop`** (the default branch).
4. Fill out the Pull Request template completely, including the `Fixes #...` issue reference. **Do not leave template fields empty.**
5. Ensure all GitHub Actions checks pass green.

Thank you for helping make AI agent memory reliable, persistent, and standardized!
